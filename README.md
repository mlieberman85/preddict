# Predicate Dictionary

*NOTE:* This is currently  a proof of concept for trying to create a predicate
dictionary for in-toto predicates. The idea is to have a library that can parse
mappings from in-toto predicates to an ontology or data model. This makes it
easy for anything that supports the predicate dictionary to ingest any data with
a known mapping to an internal data model or ontology.

*OTHER NOTE:* This should probably use one of the many semantic web things like
OWL, SHACL, JSON-LD, RDF, etc. however I can't figure it out, so putting that
off for another day.
